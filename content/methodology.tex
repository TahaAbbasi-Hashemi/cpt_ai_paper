Several metrics are extracted \gls{co}, \gls{hr}, \gls{sap}, \gls{dap}, \gls{map}, \gls{petco2}, \gls{smcav}, \gls{dmcav}, and \gls{mmcav}. The goal of these variables is to explain the reacction occuring in the waveform morphology. 

- How was waveform morphology collected

- What does the morphology mean? Is this relevant here? 

- What morphologies change over time/sex
    - Kurtosis, Skewness

- How can we explain what those features


The equation for \gls{co} multiplies the \gls{hr} with the \gls{pp} alongside a constant ($\kappa$) (set to 0.002 as calcualted by "ESTIMATING CARDIAC OUTPUT FROM BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE: THE LILJESTRAND \& ZANDER FORMULA"). 

$\text{CO} = \kappa\cdot\text{P}_\text{pulse}\cdot\text{HR}$
